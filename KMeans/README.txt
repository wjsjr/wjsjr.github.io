### This was a self-driven project I worked on to receive extra credit for an undergraduate course in data analysis (CS 3501). I was given an open-ended computer vision problem - building a machine learning algorithim which could read in pictures of handwritten numbers, and determine what number the picture represented. To tackle this, I implemented a K-Means Clustering approach using Python. I relied heavily on the numPy and pandas libraries to make this possible.
