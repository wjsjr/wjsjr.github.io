William James Sayre's Portoflio

I'm a graduate student studying for my MS Computer Science at the University of Chicago. I'm expecting to graduate in the Spring of 2022. I got my 
Bachelors at the University of Virgina, where I also studied Finance, Information Technology and Classics. I'm extremely interested in both Data Analysis and Software Engineering. I'm particularly interested in applying Machine Learning to build dynamic, responsive software.

I've uploaded a few example projects which illustrate my capabilities and background. If you would like to learn more about me, please be in touch. Here's my email address: wjsjr@uchicago.edu.

Enjoy!
