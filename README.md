# William James Sayre's Portoflio


I'm a graduate student studying computer science at the University of Chicago. I worked on the EC2 Core Platform team at AWS this past summer, where I built products at the cutting edge of networking, distributed systems and cybersecurity. I'm returning to a full-time role at AWS after graduating in September 2022. I've uploaded a few example projects which illustrate my capabilities and background. 

I'm a chess fanatic, snowboarding junky, ancient history nerd, and avid backpacker. I love classic rock, ACC basketball, good books, and good bourbon. Please reach out to me at wjsjr@uchicago.edu if you'd like to connect!
