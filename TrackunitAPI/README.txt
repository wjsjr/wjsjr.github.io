### This was part of a project I worked on during an internship at a software consulting firm. Our client was a large construction company which used Trackunit sensors on many of its vehicles. The client wanted a system which would allow them to pull the data generated by their sensors into an interface that could be used to visualize it. To accomplish this, I leveraged Javascript in conjuction with Google Data Studio & Google Big Query. Data Studio is an enterprise data visualization software that allows users to easily glean insights from large datasets. Data Studio provides a framework, called a Community Connector, that developers can follow to fetch data from 3rd party APIs and wrangle it into Data Studio Format. I implemented a custom Community Connector which our clients can leverage to query data from TU's "classic" REST APIs. To accomplish this I implemented a GUI which prompts users to provide the necessary query parameters (i.e. API key), parsed through nested JSON objects and created a dynamic schema based on the user's TU database.
